### About me
I always love learning new things ever since I was a kid and I became interested in programming back in 2017, I was just about to be 18 that time and I was amazed that I was able to tell a computer what to do. It became my hobby as I love solving things and I find programming as a great tool for that. The first programming language I learned was Java since it was very popular that time. I studied all the basic concepts of programming including OOP and some Algorithms. 
Although I can say I can learn things pretty fast, it wasn't until a year and a half before I created my first GUI application in Java using JavaFX. As much as I loved programming, there so many things I started learning during my teenage years, one of those are mathemathics and physics, also I started learning Computer Graphics, both 2D and 3D. 
Despite being a computer engineering student which is a profession that has quite nothing to do with web development, I started learning it as an additional skill during the pandemic year 2020-2021. And I find it the best way to combine my skills in programming and graphic design.
